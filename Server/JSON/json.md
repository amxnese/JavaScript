# JSON

## What is JSON

JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation. It's a lightweight data interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate. JSON is based on a subset of JavaScript syntax, but it's language-independent, meaning it's used widely beyond just JavaScript environments.

JSON is often used to exchange data between a server and a web application, serving as an alternative to XML. It's also commonly used for configuration files, API responses, and other data interchange tasks.

## Syntax

JSON syntax is simple and intuitive. It consists of key-value pairs, where keys are strings enclosed in double quotes and values can be strings, numbers, objects, arrays, booleans, or null.
