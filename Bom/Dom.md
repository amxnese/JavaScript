# "BOM" typically refers to the Browser Object Model. The Browser Object Model is a hierarchical representation of objects that comprise a web browser's interface. It allows JavaScript to interact with the browser itself, including manipulating the browser window, navigating to different URLs, accessing browser history, managing cookies, and handling events such as mouse clicks and keyboard input

Key components of the Browser Object Model include:

Window Object: The global object in client-side JavaScript, representing the browser window or frame. It provides methods and properties for interacting with the browser environment.

Document Object: Represents the HTML document displayed in the browser window. It provides access to the structure and content of the document, allowing manipulation of its elements and attributes.

Location Object: Provides information about the current URL being displayed in the browser window and methods to navigate to different URLs.

Navigator Object: Provides information about the browser itself, such as its name, version, and capabilities.

History Object: Represents the user's browsing history in the current browser window, allowing navigation through previously visited pages.

Screen Object: Provides information about the user's screen, such as its dimensions and color depth.

The Browser Object Model enables developers to create dynamic and interactive web applications by allowing JavaScript code to interact with and control various aspects of the browser environment.
