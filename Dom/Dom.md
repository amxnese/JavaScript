# DOM

stands for Document Object Model. It is a programming interface for web documents. Essentially, it represents the structure of HTML or XML documents as a tree-like model where each node represents a part of the document, such as elements, attributes, and text.

In the context of web development:

Document: Refers to the web page itself. The document object serves as an entry point into the web page's content.
Object: Each part of the document, like elements, attributes, and text, is represented as an object.
Model: Describes how these objects are structured and how they interact with each other.
The DOM provides a way for programs/scripts to dynamically access and update the content, structure, and style of HTML documents. It allows developers to manipulate the document's elements, attributes, and text content using programming languages like JavaScript
